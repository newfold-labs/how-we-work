## Naming Projects

Naming projects well from the beginning can prevent lots of labor to correct down-the-line. Many projects grow to accomodate new requirements over time, so while we can't predict the future and always prevent refactoring names, we can still try to measure twice, name once.

### All packages should match their repository name

Passing a project name through `kebabCase()` should ideally always return the repository name. And the `README.md`, `composer.json` and `package.json` names should generally sync up (with the exception of the `@` organization prefix in JavaScript).

## Standard

In lieu of fancy codenames and clever, aspirational abstracts, we largely follow the following convention:

### `{platform}-{type}-{name}`

We have prescribed prefixes for many of our Common Product Conventions below.

_Please keep reading to understand when `platform` and `type` conditionally apply._

### Platform

The platform is the destination technology where the code executes. These may be a specific service, library or more general language identifier.

| Tag          | Platform
| ------------ | ----------
| `aws`        | Amazon
| `cf`         | Cloudflare
| `gatsby`     | Gatsby
| `gh`         | GitHub
| `laravel`    | Laravel
| `wp`         | WordPress
| `wp-cli`     | WP-CLI
| `node`       | Node
| `webpack`    | webpack
| `php`        | php
| `js`         | js
| `react`      | React

### Type

The type often reflects a specific classification or product name that comes from a library or service.

* `aws-lambda-{name}`
* `cf-worker-{name}`
* `gatsby-plugin-{name}`
* `gatsby-theme-{name}`
* `gh-action-{name}`
* `wp-plugin-{name}`
* `wp-theme-{name}`

This list is not comprehensive, please see the Common Product Conventions below.

### Name

The name should aim to be brief, descriptive and inclusive of potential growth, without getting verbose, jargon-y or overly specific.

| Avoid                                              | Preferred
| -------------------------------------------------- | ----------
| `aws-lambda-headless-png-screenshot-service`       | `aws-lambda-screenshot-service`
| `wp-module-frontend-filebased-caching`             | `wp-module-performance`
| `wp-plugin-bluehost-support-desk-integration`      | `wp-module-support` (then added to `wp-plugin-bluehost`)
| `gh-action-lint-build-wp-plugin`                   | `gh-action-release-wp-plugin`

### Notable Exceptions

As with any standard, this helps us address about 80% of use cases.

#### Redundancies

Avoid repeating and redundant names like `satis-satis-satis` or `cf-worker-workers` for a monorepo of workers.

Just `satis` or `cf-workers` or `cf-workers-{proxies|notifications}` suffice.

#### Cross-platform repositories

Our `scaffolding-templates` don't have just one platform or type, so both prefixes are dropped.

#### Generally we avoid brand, company and team names in platforms

For the greatest evergreen resiliancy, we typically avoid prescribing features to specific brands, even if they're only used on a subset. This way, if another brand needs that feature, we're not putting a `{brand}-{feature}` into a different brand.

| Avoid                            | Preferred
| -------------------------------- | ----------
| `wp-module-bluehost-staging`     | `wp-module-staging`
| `webpack-plugin-newfold`         | `webpack-plugin` (@newfold-labs/webpack-plugin)
| `wp-module-netsol-sso`           | `wp-module-sso` (with separate netsol file)
| `cf-worker-webcom-legacy-compat` | `cf-worker-legacy-features` (with webcom method, space for others)

The obvious exception are our "brand plugins" whose sole purpose is serving a single brand like `wp-plugin-bluehost`.

### Composer Packages

#### Standard

```
newfold-labs/{package-name}
```

Our PHP codebases are often Composer packages we distribute using Satis, and should follow [Composer naming conventions](https://getcomposer.org/doc/04-schema.md#name).

### JavaScript Packages

### Standard
```
@newfold-labs/{package-name}
```

This is [essential for GitHub Packages](https://docs.github.com/en/packages/working-with-a-github-packages-registry/working-with-the-npm-registry#publishing-a-package) to work correctly.

#### Note on Monorepos

If JavaScript code is in a monorepo, the top-level config should follow the standard above.

For packages inside the monorepo, they should ideally branch off the top-level config's name.

i.e.
```
@newfold-labs/node-helpers
@newfold-labs/node-helpers-mustache
@newfold-labs/node-helpers-fs
@newfold-labs/node-helpers-axios
```

However, as some libraries such as Gatsby rely on package names for some functionality (i.e. `gatsby-theme-`), those packages are an exception to this standard and should follow the library standards.
