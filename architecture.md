# Architecture

## Philosophies

* Every architecture has it's pitfalls. Our job isn't to find perfect, it's to find the best set of compromises for a project.
* When an organization shares similar structure and norms between like codebases, everyone is empowered to work on everything.
* Sometimes we have to default to what libraries expect and demand when modifying creates maintenance burden and risk, but in general we like to adapt libraries to our standards when there are stable and sensable ways to do so.
