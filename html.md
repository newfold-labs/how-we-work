# HTML

Whether we're serving content documents to the public, embedding experiences inside WordPress or creating Single-Page Applications, we aim for certain goals in the HTML we write and generate dynamically.

## Best Practices
* Prefer native elements to JavaScript-powered abstractions.
* When attributes overflow into horizontal scrolling, break into separate lines.
* Prefer data in data attributes, not CSS classes.

## Accessibility
* All projects should pass WCAG 2.1 Level A Standards.
* All projects should strive for WCAG 2.1 Level AA Standards.
* ARIA attributes are a last resort, but often a necessary.
* Good image accessibility means having good descriptions in alt attributes, not just having alt attributes.

## Structure

All projects should strive for semantic HTML elements like <main>, <article> and <aside> over generic <div>'s.
