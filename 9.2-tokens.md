# Tokens
Due to including various private packages which are github hosted, local development environments require some skilled token management. Here is a standard and defacto practice to ensure access to these packages when developing locally and how to manage these tokens in runners.

## Local Development
In order for a developer (githib user) to have access to the private github hosted packages, they'll need two things:
- They must be added to a newfold-labs team in github.
- They must have a token set up with read access to packages.

Contact your team lead if you are not already added to the proper team in the org.

Follow these steps to set up a personal access token:
- Go to the Github developer settings (currently found at the bottom of the settings side nav).
- Go to the Personal access tokens (classic) page. (This should be the url: https://github.com/settings/tokens)
- Generate a new (classic) token (click the button in the top of the page)
- Choose a name for your token and set an expiration. Since access is revoked from a user once they are removed from an org team in github we can set a long expiration.
- Select desired access scope: Check the box for `read:packages` and then Generate token.
- Copy the token, it should resemble `ghp_xXxXxX`
- On your development machine, go the root of your user directory and create or find a `.npmrc` file. (You may need to ensure hidden files are visible.)
- Add the token to this file like so:
```
legacy-peer-deps=true
@newfold-labs:registry=https://npm.pkg.github.com/
# My Personal Access Token
//npm.pkg.github.com/:_authToken=ghp_xXxXxX
```

## Github Runner Access
Consider that the github workflows and actions require access to these files as well, but we can NOT add a token to any repo because it will jepordize the security of the private packages. The workflow will create a similar `.npmrc` file while building the plugins and get a token from a repository secret. It will use this to install any private packages and then when prepping files for distribution, ignore the file with token.
