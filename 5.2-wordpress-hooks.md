# WordPress Hooks

Custom action and filter hooks are critical to robust WordPress products.

Via `do_action()` and `apply_filters()` in PHP, developers can extend, limit and modify WordPress Core and other third-party codebases running in a WordPress environment.

## Code that should often have a custom filter

* WP_Query arguments
* HTTP API option configs
* PHP data inlined in the DOM for scripts
* Data and configs that external codebases may want to modify

## Code that should often have a custom action

* Preflight / postflight actions in a codebase (i.e. installation)
* PHP interfaces can be built using actions (i.e. `app_below_header`, `app_body`, `app_below_footer`)

## More than one variable? Use a single array argument

WordPress supports more than one attribute in hooks, however remembering the order of these positional arguments can get challenging even with good inline and supporting documentation. So if there's more than one piece of data, we prefer an associative array with keys and values to multiple positional arguments so we only need to remember keys, not order.

## Hook priority for execution timing.

WordPress uses a integer-based priority system with the default being 10. Most Core uses max-out at 100.

* Use increments of 5 to set hook timing, the big exception being between 0 and 10.
* Don't use `PHP_INT_MAX` or super-late, "multi-nine" priorities like `999999`.
* If more than three zeroes, incrementation like `12345` is preferred to `10000` for legibility. Try to stay below 200 unless you are overcoming a third-party product.

## It's frowned upon to use anonymous methods or closures in hook callbacks.

Anonymous functions defeat the purpose of hooks in that they're a royal nuisance to remove using `remove_action()` or `remove_filter()`.

Except in the rare case where the explicit intention is to make it difficult to remove a hook, callbacks should always be a named function or class that can be declared in other codebases for removal.

## Hook diagnostic

The [list of available WordPress Actions](https://codex.wordpress.org/Plugin_API/Action_Reference) can vary by site because third-party plugins can add their own hosts. Hooks are executed in a runtime sequence -- not all hooks are available to Plugins and Themes, some hooks are WordPres Admin-only, some hooks have dynamic names, etc.

As best practice is to use a developer tool like [Query Monitor](https://wordpress.org/plugins/query-monitor/) to inspect available hooks and attached methods. If code isn't executing, Query Monitor can tell you with certainty if getting registered.

If you're troubleshooting hooks make sure...
* You're registration method is executing -- file being executed, method being executed?
* You're not trying to tap into a hook too late.
* You're not trying to attach a protected or private method as a hook callback.
