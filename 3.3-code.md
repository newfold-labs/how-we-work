## Start generic, narrow to specific

By starting our names with generic ideas and narrowing to more specific, it's easier to add adjacent code and ideas that follow the same pattern.

* `nfd-bluehost-widget-account` > `bluehost-account-widget`
* `nfd-module-data-helper-admin` > `data-module-admin-helper`

## Prefer specific to vague

Specificity creates a natural growth path without needing to rename/rekey overly-generic keys.

* `nf_account_data` > `nf_account`
* `nf_plugin_updates_cache` over `nf_plugins`

## Use singular equivalent to plural in loops

By using the singular variant of a plural, it becomes clear what comes from what. It's also preferred to avoid using data types as names -- please put those in documentation.

| ❌ Avoid                | ✅ Preferred
| ----------------------- | --------------
| `for post in items`     | `for post in posts`
| `for single in posts`   | `for post in posts`
| `for object in objects` | `for user in users`
