# Organization Teams
Access to repositories on GitHub is controlled by assigning the repo to a team. Team leads are responsible for managing membership in their respective teams.

You can find the respective teams at https://github.com/orgs/newfold-labs/teams.

Granting (or revoking) access to any repository is as simple as adding (or removing) an individual from the appropriate team. All repositories have been assigned a topic/tag with the name of the owning team. You can view the organization's repositories here to determine which repository belongs to each team: https://github.com/orgs/newfold-labs/repositories.

Whenever possible, it is recommended to avoid adding individual users directly to repositories and instead add them to the relevant team. Adding a team to the repository is preferable over adding a single user.
