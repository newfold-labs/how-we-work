# Organization Teams
Access to repositoires in github is controlled by assigning the repo to a team. Team leads need to manage membership in their team. 

Please find respective teams at https://github.com/orgs/newfold-labs/teams

Giving (or revoking) access to any repository is as easy as adding (or removing) an individual to the proper team. All repositories have been given a topic/tag with the owner team name. View the org repositories here to see which repository belongs to which team: https://github.com/orgs/newfold-labs/repositories

Adding individual users to any repository should be avoided if possible in favor of adding the user to the proper team. Adding a team to the repository is preferable to adding a single user.
