# Translation Workflow Guide

This document outlines the process for managing translations in our WordPress plugin module repositories using Crowdin and GitHub Actions.

## Workflow Overview

Our translation process consists of two GitHub Actions workflows:
1. **Crowdin Upload Action**: Uploads the latest source file (`.pot` file) to Crowdin.
2. **Crowdin Download Action**: Downloads translated `.po` files from Crowdin and creates a pull request against the selected branch.

After downloading the translations, additional steps are required to generate the necessary translation files for PHP and JavaScript.

## Steps for Managing Translations

### 1. Upload Source File to Crowdin
If there are untranslated strings, follow these steps to upload the updated source file to Crowdin:

1. Navigate to the **GitHub repository**.
2. Go to the **Actions** tab.
3. Select **Crowdin Upload Action**.
4. Click **Run workflow** (ensure you are in the correct branch).
5. The workflow will upload the updated `.pot` file to Crowdin.

### 2. Translate in Crowdin
1. Log in to [Crowdin](https://crowdin.com/).
2. Navigate to the respective project.
3. Use **machine translations** or **manual translations** to complete the missing translations.
4. Ensure translations are reviewed and approved.

### 3. Download Translations from Crowdin
Once translations are completed in Crowdin, follow these steps to download the translated `.po` files:

1. Navigate to the **GitHub repository**.
2. Go to the **Actions** tab.
3. Select **Crowdin Download Action**.
4. Click **Run workflow**.
5. Specify the **base branch** where you want the PR to be raised (default: `main`).
6. The workflow will download translations and create a pull request.

### 4. Verify and Generate Translation Files
After the pull request is created:
1. **Review the translations** in the `.po` files for accuracy and correctness.
2. Once verified, **merge the pull request**.
3. Run the following commands to generate translation files for PHP and JS:
   ```sh
   composer i18n-mo
   composer i18n-php
   composer i18n-json
   ```
4. Commit and push the generated files if necessary.

## Notes
- Ensure that the necessary **Crowdin API credentials** are configured in the repository secrets (`CROWDIN_PROJECT_ID` and `CROWDIN_PERSONAL_TOKEN`).

By following this workflow, we can efficiently manage and maintain translations for our WordPress plugin modules.
