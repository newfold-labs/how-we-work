## Cadence

- We will do a new release every two weeks on Wednesdays. 
- Code must be in a PR the Wednesday before the release date to be considered.

## Compatability

- All production code must be compatible with the 3 latest WordPress versions.
- All production code must be compatible with the latest version of PHP back to any version of PHP with more than 5% 
  usage as [per the WordPress stats page](https://wordpress.org/about/stats/#php_versions).
