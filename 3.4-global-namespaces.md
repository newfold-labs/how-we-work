# Global Namespaces

Sometimes we need to execute code in a global namespace in PHP or JavaScript, or key data in databases and caches in environments we don't control.

Common database keys like `api_url`, `plugin_config` or `system_status` could be set by another codebase -- so we need to be defensive with our naming.

## General Best Practice

* Most constants, variables and methods should receive an `nfd` prefix.
* **This is a global namespace**. Be defensive, clear and courteous. Safety and clarity over brevity.
* **Consistiently use a product prefix after the company prefix** to aid locating code (i.e. searching `nfd_performance_module_` to find all hooks).
* **Avoid jargon and acronyms in handles**. Save it for inline documentation!

### Examples

* `nfd_api_url`
* `nfd_system_status`
* `nfd_brand_config`
* `nfd-brand-widget`
* `nfd_register_modules()`

The notable exception being something well-prefixed where the `nfd` is overly-verbose:

`wp-plugin-bluehost-admin` is a fine asset handle, a `nfd-` prefix is overkill.
