# Naming Files & Directories

Some software expects or relies on certain directory structures and filenames (like `/src` in Gatsby, `webpack.config.js` in the root for wp-scripts, etc), while others aren't prescriptive or reliant on specific naming and location.

As a result, naming is pretty conditional, but we have some general preferences and more specific practices.

## General

### Avoid abbreviations like `/inc`, `/src` and `/bin`

We generally prefer `/includes`, `/source` and `/scripts`. The notable exception is common technology acronyms like `/css` or `/js` instead of `/cascading-style-sheets`|`/stylesheets` or `/javascript`.

### While Composer PSR-4 autoloading is case-insensitive, directory structures should reflect namespace capitalization

While `/includes/admin/Menu.php` works fine for `\Newfold\WP\Module\Admin\Menu()` with proper root-mapping to `/includes`, `/includes/Admin/Menu.php` is preferred.

## WordPress

While we generally follow "the WordPres way," for PSR-4 autoloaded files, we don't use the `class-{name}.php` prefix common in WordPress Core.
